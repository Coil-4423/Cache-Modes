### **Cache Modes Explanation**

### **1. `default`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Uses the browser's default cache behavior.
  - Typically reuses cached resources if available and updates them as needed.
- **Use Case**:
  - Standard web requests where no specific cache behavior is required.

---

### **2. `no-store`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Does not read from or write to the cache.
  - Ensures every request fetches a fresh copy from the server.
- **Use Case**:
  - Sensitive or one-time-use data (e.g., security tokens).

---

### **3. `reload`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Bypasses the cache entirely and fetches a fresh copy from the server.
  - Updates the cache with the new response.
- **Use Case**:
  - Critical data that must always be up-to-date (e.g., stock prices, live updates).

---

### **4. `no-cache`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Revalidates the resource with the server before using it.
  - If the server confirms the cached resource is valid, the cached version is used.
  - Otherwise, a fresh copy is fetched, and the cache is updated.
- **Use Case**:
  - Balances freshness and efficiency for frequently changing data.

---

### **5. `force-cache`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Uses the cache even if the resource is stale.
  - Makes a network request only if the resource is not in the cache.
- **Use Case**:
  - Prioritize performance by minimizing network requests when real-time updates are not critical.

---

### **6. `only-if-cached`**
- **Behavior**:
  - Serves the resource only if it is available in the cache.
  - Throws an error if the resource is not in the cache.
  - **Note**: This mode requires `mode: 'same-origin'` to work.
- **Use Case**:
  - Offline-first scenarios or when working with pre-cached resources.

| **Mode**          | **Reads Cache** | **Validates Cache** | **Updates Cache** | **Fetches from Network**       |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `default`         | Yes             | Yes (if required)   | Yes               | Yes (if required)             |
| `no-store`        | No              | No                  | No                | Always                         |
| `reload`          | No              | No                  | Yes               | Always                         |
| `no-cache`        | Yes             | Yes                 | Yes               | Only if validation fails       |
| `force-cache`     | Yes             | No                  | No                | Only if resource is not cached |
| `only-if-cached`  | Yes             | No                  | No                | Never                          |

### **When to Use Each Mode**
- **`default`**: When no special cache behavior is needed.
- **`no-store`**: For sensitive or temporary data.
- **`reload`**: When fresh data is always required.
- **`no-cache`**: When a balance of freshness and performance is needed.
- **`force-cache`**: When prioritizing performance and cached data suffices.
- **`only-if-cached`**: For offline scenarios or guaranteed cached resources.
